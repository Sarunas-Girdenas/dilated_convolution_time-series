# Short Description
Here we implement Dilated 1D convolution for time series classification heavily based on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04691.pdf).
The main code is somewhat inspired by [this](https://louisenaud.github.io/time_series_prediction.html) implementation. However, the structure of the network is different as well as some implementation details.
See notebook for examples or run the code to optimize parameters using Optuna.
